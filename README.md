# Tic Tac Toe

Built this following the requirements from The Odin Project (TOP). It contains only one global variable that encasuplases all the logic of the game. I also added an extra feature with scores for each player, and how the board ended for the winning player.

My major problems were using two factory functions that are fairly similar, and I could have divided them in classes, also the logic for checking the winner I feel like for vertical and horizonal there would be no problem in expanding it to a 10x10 grid or 100x100, but I couldn't come up with a way to check for diagonal win that could respond well to scalability
